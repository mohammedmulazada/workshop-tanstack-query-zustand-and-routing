# Introduction

Hello! This is a bear bones (yes there might be some puns, inspired by zustand's readme) workshop.

It's most likely the ugliest workshop styling wise, but for a simple workshop it should be enough.

I setup a simple node express back-end that has endpoints related to todos (everyone's favourite tech excercise topic).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open two terminal tabs
3. In one, go to the front-end folder, in the other the server folder
4. For both do `npm i`
5. In the server folder, type `npm start`
6. In the front-end folder, type `npm run dev`

If done correctly, you should be able to get data back if you visit this url: http://localhost:3000/todos

The front-end should be viewable at http://localhost:5173/.
